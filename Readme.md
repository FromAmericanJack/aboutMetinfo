## what do for this pro.?
When developing related business in China, you should be cautious of Chinese copyright rogue companies such as Metinfo, DEDE, VCG, etc. They have a large legal team, and some companies even focus on litigation as their main business. For example, Metinfo, as explained in this section, many related companies have received lawsuits.

We are not clear about the definition of Chinese technology enterprises, but these companies claim to be high-tech industry companies in China.The available technologies are already outdated, even software developed using technologies from over 10 or 20 years ago. In fact, they are not centered around technological development, but rather force you to cooperate with another party through litigation, and even completely blackmail you for a sum of money.

I don't know, do Chinese laws recognize open source protocols? Metinfo contains a large number of GPL components, but it did not comply with the GPL protocol and instead wrote a new protocol, limiting certain rights and using it as a basis for prosecution.

About metinfoï¼Œhow can you accurately identify the thousands of lawsuits per year? Because they have the following code, they can easily obtain detailed user information. So this is only for analysis.
